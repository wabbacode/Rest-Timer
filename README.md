# Rest-Timer
Simple fitness rest timer that counts down to 0.

This is my Rest Timer (JJ Interval Timer) which I made as a simple project to practise. 
A simple Windows Forms application written in C#. The application is designed for workouts, I actually use this myself. 

Features:
	Customizable Timer Duration: Adjust the total time between 30, 60, or 90 seconds.
	Tick sound played at regular intervals.
	Beep sound played when the timer completes.

-- Ensure the tick and beep sound files (tick.wav and beep.wav) are located in the same directory as the application executable. --

How to Use

	- Use the track bar to select a preset timer duration (30, 60, or 90 seconds).
		Alternatively, enter a custom duration in the provided text box(Hidden in Settings).

	Press the Start button to begin the timer.
	
	Sound Settings:

		Ensure the tick and beep sound files (tick.wav and beep.wav) are located in the same directory as the application executable.
